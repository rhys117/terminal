The process to get it
1. Install and configure iTerm2
Apply the color scheme in iTerm2
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Clovis-team/clovis-open-code-extracts/master/utils/Clovis-iTerm2-Color-Scheme.itermcolors
iTerm ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Colors ‚Üí Color presets ‚Üí Import
Then again, Color presets ‚Üí you-color-scheme-name

2. Install a patched font
The patched font is the font used by iTerm2 to display characters, and you‚Äôll need a special one for special characters like arrows and git icons.
https://github.com/powerline/fonts/blob/master/Meslo%20Slashed/Meslo%20LG%20M%20Regular%20for%20Powerline.ttf
Open the downloaded font and press ‚ÄúInstall Font‚Äù on your computer.
Add the font in iTerm2
iTerm2 ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text ‚Üí Change Font

3. Install Zsh and Oh my Zsh
brew install zsh zsh-completions
Oh my Zsh is a Zsh configuration framework, you can read more here: github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh.
To install it :
$ sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
Edit the ~/.zshrc configuration file which is run when the terminal starts. At any time you can compare it with Clovis .zshrc configuration file üéÅ

4. Add Powerlevel9k Zsh Theme
The Powerlevel9k zsh theme adds many other features like a right promp with infos such as exit codes and timestamps. To install it run:
$ git clone https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/powerlevel9k
Then edit ~/.zshrc configuration file and set

5. Final tweaking
Lines to your ~/.zshrcconfiguration file :
POWERLEVEL9K_LEFT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(dir rbenv vcs)
POWERLEVEL9K_RIGHT_PROMPT_ELEMENTS=(status root_indicator background_jobs history time)
Moreover to make the two lines prompt you have to add this :
POWERLEVEL9K_PROMPT_ON_NEWLINE=true

# Add a space in the first prompt
POWERLEVEL9K_MULTILINE_FIRST_PROMPT_PREFIX="%f"

# Visual customisation of the second prompt line
local user_symbol="$"
if [[ $(print -P "%#") =~ "#" ]]; then
    user_symbol = "#"
fi
POWERLEVEL9K_MULTILINE_LAST_PROMPT_PREFIX="%{%B%F{black}%K{yellow}%} $user_symbol%{%b%f%k%F{yellow}%}ÓÇ∞ %{%f%}"
More about POWERLEVEL9K prompts options here, and deeper customizations here: https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-customize-your-command-prompt--net-24083

Enable text editor navigation
Vertical cursor
iTerm2 ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Text
‚Üí Cursor : ‚úì Vertical Bar
‚Üí Blinking cursor : ‚úì ON

Text navigation with keyboard
Moreover, by default, word jumps (option + ‚Üí or ‚Üê) and word deletions (option + backspace) do not work on iTerm2. To enable them, go to:
iTerm ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Profiles ‚Üí Keys ‚Üí Load Preset‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Natural Text Editing

Restart iTerm2 for all changes to take effect.
Auto suggestions (for Oh My Zsh)
This plugin suggests the commands you used in your terminal history. You just have to type ‚Üí to fill it entirely
$ git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
Note: $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins path is by default ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins
Add the plugin to the list of plugins in ~/.zshrcconfiguration file :
plugins=(
    ‚Ä¶
    zsh-autosuggestions
)
Start a new terminal session.
More details here : github.com/tarruda/zsh-autosuggestions#oh-my-zsh
Note : if the auto suggestions do not appear to show, it could be a problem with your color scheme. Under ‚ÄúiTerm ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Colors tab‚Äù, check the value of Black Bright, that is the color your auto suggestions will have. It will be displayed on top of the Background color. If there is not enough contrast between the two, you won‚Äôt see the suggestions even if they‚Äôre actually there..
Syntax highlighting
The highlighting shows if commands are installed and known by the shell, and gives better output colors.

$ brew install zsh-syntax-highlighting
If you do not have or do not like homebrew, follow the installation instructions instead.
After installation through homebrew, add the next line to the end of your ~/.zshrc file :
source /usr/local/share/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
After that, it's best to restart your terminal. Sourcing your ~/.zshrc file withsource ~/.zshrc command does not seem to work well with this plugin.
New line after each prompt

Before

After (better readability)
Again, add this lines to your ~/.zshrcconfiguration file :
POWERLEVEL9K_PROMPT_ADD_NEWLINE=true
Change color of warning git status
Set it as red for better readability (and not orange). Just add this line:
POWERLEVEL9K_VCS_MODIFIED_BACKGROUND=‚Äôred‚Äô
Change color of iTerm2 Tabs

Same game, just add these lines at the end of ~/.zshrcconfiguration file and restart your term:
# Colorise the top Tabs of Iterm2 with the same color as background
# Just change the 18/26/33 wich are the rgb values
echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;red;brightness;18\a"
echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;green;brightness;26\a"
echo -e "\033]6;1;bg;blue;brightness;33\a"
6. Visual Studio Code config
Installing a patched font will mess up the integrated terminal in VS Code unless you use the proper settings. You‚Äôll need to go to settings (CMD + ,) and add or edit the following values:
for Meslo: "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Meslo LG M for Powerline"
for Source Code Pro: "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "Source Code Pro for Powerline"
for other fonts you‚Äôll need to check the font name in Font Book.
You can also set the font size e.g.: "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 12

7. Add `DEVELOPMENT_PATH` export and zsh_env.sh as source
 # ~/.zshrc
```
export DEVELOPMENT_PATH=/users/you/development_directory
source ~/path/to/repo/terminal/zsh_env.sh
```

8. mod commands to be executable
```
chmod 755 "commands/<command name>"
```
